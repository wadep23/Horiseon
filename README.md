# Code Refactor Starter Code
Read me

    Horiseon is a social solution service company who's aim is to help bring their cleints reach a much broader client base through the use of different tools such as: Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management and Social Media Marketing.

    The sites intention is to convey the company Brand and Mission by further defining the way they  execute their process and build value for their service.

What I did

    For this project I reviewed the existing code and style sheet to identify missing components and further optimize the code. I identified a broken link intended to take the user to the reputation management section as well as missing alt tags for images. There were several issues with the style sheet as far as cascade principles go. I rearranged the layout to better match the flow of the HTML file code and condensed sections where possible. Converted an image element to self closing. Added image alt's to increase accessability. I also removed the unneeded stlye clear: both;. Removed un used lines where possible as well.
